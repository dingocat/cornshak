	<h1> Corn Shak Blog! </h1>
		<h2> Decembuary 45, 2000 </h2>
		<p> Today was a good day.  Me and the Poopn Pals got together with some Chunk Grog, (bud light and creamed corn with a splash of kaluha).  Also brought the dogs down with us to the Corn Shak.  Shot the shit, for real.  It was a grand ol' time. Thinkin about a new drink that you put Cocopuffs and Gravy Train into.  Could be good.  They both make their own sauces when you mix em with liquid.  That's all for now in the Corn Shak! </p>
			<p>Gnight,</p>
